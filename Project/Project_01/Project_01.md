## <div align="center"> Why do we need to address Energy Poverty?  


<br /> ***Sustainable energy consumption can help mitigate factors leading to poverty.***
 Energy is a vital resource and essential for survival and prosperity; it provides millions of people sustainability in three distinct aspects:


*   Economic 
*   Social 
*   Environmental

Therefore, this study aims to discuss each theme's respective indicators to demonstrate the importance of electricity accessibility and its effects on the selected countries.

Economic:
>Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is an economic indicator from WDI to measure macroeconomic performance or economic activity in a country. This study utilizes GDP as a variable to represent growth in the economy of a nation.

Social:
>This study examines energy's social impact on residents. However, because there is no standard social indicator that can measure general social activity, total mobile subscribers are used instead to understand if energy provides reliable and fast communication.

Environmental:
>We studied the effects of energy on climate over time and used CO2 emissions (metric tons per capita) to understand the impact of producing energy.

When examining energy usage across various countries raises a spotlight on an ongoing issue, which offers a unique opportunity for both nonprofit organizations and for-profit institutions to benefit. In this report, the term 'Energy' is used interchangeably with world electricity. It is essential to understand that having access to electricity is vital in overcoming several developmental barriers for underdeveloped countries and collectively as a global economy.

## <div align="center"> Background
*********************************************************
Over several decades, several developing countries have received funding through multiple projects to improve living conditions and reduce the poverty of residents. With the World Bank's efforts, it is essential to explore the effects of external contributors on eradicating poverty. Economic, social, and environmental indicators interest me to prove why everyone should have access to electricity. I firmly believe access to electricity is fundamental to improving the quality of impoverished areas in developing countries and improving telecommunication.

 The Word's Bank is a financial organization with a dual mission to end extreme poverty and promote prosperity by providing funds to developing countries. The World Bank addresses prominent issues, including energy, health, and infrastructure. According to annual reports, 10% of the world population lives without electricity, which, in turn, creates an obstacle to economic development in developing countries. Collectively, many countries face the challenge of generating electricity due to numerous factors such as poor infrastructures, leading to severe energy poverty.

The image below demonstrates energy poverty taken by NASA, which gained the attention of millions. The visual representation of regions experiencing energy poverty, as you can see, a large portion of the world does not have access to electricity. This is very alarming as it has massive implications for economic and social developments and adverse effects on the well-being of the affecting population.

<br />

Well-developed regions, in particular the United States, have access to energy. As a result, it is safe to infer this contributes mainly to the United States GPD. Electricity has a positive impact on the GDP and is a primary economic example of how accessibility to energy can benefit a given economy.


However, it is also essential to understand how energy impacts communication, specifically telecommunication. How does information spreads to residents who experience energy poverty? What does it look like for a country with low electricity generation to reach mobile users in the face of an emergency? I have explored the topic further and will later explain my findings below.

In the paragraphs below, I will introduce the purpose and expand on how energy’s accessibility influences telecommunication, an ideal social factor that represents societal communication, which enables participation and development from the government to residents. 


## <div align="center"> Purpose
*********************************************************

<br />

Electricity accessibility and mobile communication are exciting topics for a social researcher, considering the climate we are experiencing today. As we face a pandemic, quick communication is critical in spreading awareness and saving lives during a crisis or emergency. Through mobile communication, governments have direct, reliable access to their respective population when promptly informing their citizens of any urgent news, especially in rural areas. For example, at the pandemic's peak, the United States government sent out wireless emergency alerts to all mobile users, alerting their citizens of its declaration of national emergency and issued links to credible resources to help their citizens stay informed of the crisis. This course of action is made possible to the United States of America.

More importantly, collecting reliable data to produce valuable findings and generate insightful visualizations is a persistent challenge for many data analysts. Data exploration is the initial step before analyzing data and requires a data analyst to formulate certain expected conclusions or outcomes. In other words, forming a hypothesis and conclusion while exploring the data is the best approach. Then, readjusting expectations or redefining questions to answer and examine the information is a typical process that I always use during data exploration. In this report, I will walk you through my investigation, process, and results. In addition, I provided my best practices in steps in order.

Best practices: 
1.	Formulate a hypothesis. 
2.	Ask questions.
3.	Research
4.	Reevaluate previous questions. 
5.	Exam Data.
6.	Generate findings based on the data and research. 
7.	Conduct a conclusion.

## <div align="center">  Investiagtion
*********************************************************
**What is it that you are investigating/exploring/analyzing (provide sufficient background information)?**

I am researching the relationship between electricity accessibility and a country's GDP over some time.

I am exploring the relationship between electricity accessibility and the total of mobile users in each country over some time.

Last, I am exploring the relationship between electricity accessibility and a country's climate over time.


**Why is it important to you and/or to others?**

Economy growth is known to increase shared prosperity, especially amongst the poor over time. As a result, it improves the life quality of the residents.

Mobile phone usage is heavily dependent on efficient energy; without reliable electricity, mobile users face the challenge of charging their devices and sustaining connectivity amongst themselves throughout the area.

 Analyzing the correlation between the two indicators reveals an ongoing concern, which is communication. It is crucial, especially in an emergency, for public officials and government officials to send alerts and urgent messages to their citizens.

Finally, it is crucial to understand the effects of increasing accessibility in a county's climate.



>**The questions I have in mind are :**
*        Does energy increases properity ?
*        Is there economic growth when there is an increase to electrity accessbility?
*        Does the total of mobile subscriptions increase due to an increase accessibility of energy over time?
*        Does a country with a higher GPA have more mobile subscribers?
*        What are the drivers that contributes to access electricity?
*        Will it hurt the climate?

## <div align="center"> Conclusion
*********************************************************


It isn’t easy to come to a concrete conclusion from just the indicators. Moreover, it’s difficult to determine a strong correlation between the indicators in the charts; However, based on the research and findings, I believe an increase in accessibility to electricity does improve a country’s GDP. For example, countries with the highest GDP also have more access to electricity than countries with lower GDP.

In addition, access to electricity and the size of the population does increase the number of mobile subscribers. For instance, in 2000, India had one of the lowest amounts of mobile cellular subscriptions; however, due to the rise in electricity accessibility in India and the rise in the population size, India has the highest mobile cellular subscriptions. 
Last, the chart shows a correlation between CO2 emission and access to electricity (% of population). Countries with the higher assess ability to electricity also have the higher CO2 emission.

Overall, although an increase in accessibility of electricity does promote a higher GDP and a better quality of life, charts show it negatively affect their environment in terms of pollution. However, this con does not outweigh the benefits of providing more people access to energy as it promotes economic growth and wellness in individuals.  The reason we should address energy poverty is that it improves lives.
