        "Over several decades, several developing countries have received funding through multiple projects to improve living conditions and reduce the poverty of residents. With the World Bank's efforts, it is essential to explore the effects of external contributors on eradicating poverty. Economic, social, and environmental indicators interest me to prove why everyone should have access to electricity. I firmly believe access to electricity is fundamental to improving the quality of impoverished areas in developing countries and improving telecommunication.\n",

        " The Word's Bank is a financial organization with a dual mission to end extreme poverty and promote prosperity by providing funds to developing countries. The World Bank addresses prominent issues, including energy, health, and infrastructure. According to annual reports, 10% of the world population lives without electricity, which, in turn, creates an obstacle to economic development in developing countries. Collectively, many countries face the challenge of generating electricity due to numerous factors such as poor infrastructures, leading to severe energy poverty.\n",

        "Electricity accessibility and mobile communication are exciting topics for a social researcher, considering the climate we are experiencing today. As we face a pandemic, quick communication is critical in spreading awareness and saving lives during a crisis or emergency. Through mobile communication, governments have direct, reliable access to their respective population when promptly informing their citizens of any urgent news, especially in rural areas. For example, at the pandemic's peak, the United States government sent out wireless emergency alerts to all mobile users, alerting their citizens of its declaration of national emergency and issued links to credible resources to help their citizens stay informed of the crisis. This course of action is made possible to the United States of America.\n",

Then, readjusting expectations or redefining questions to answer and examine the information is a typical process that I always use during data exploration.

Moreover, it’s difficult to determine a strong correlation between the indicators in the charts; However, based on the research and findings, I believe an increase in accessibility to electricity does improve a country’s GDP. For example, countries with the highest GDP also have more access to electricity than countries with lower GDP.\n",

        "In addition, access to electricity and the size of the population does increase the number of mobile subscribers. For instance, in 2000, India had one of the lowest amounts of mobile cellular subscriptions; however, due to the rise in electricity accessibility in India and the rise in the population size, India has the highest mobile cellular subscriptions. \n",

However, this con does not outweigh the benefits of providing more people access to energy as it promotes economic growth and wellness in individuals.  The reason we should address energy poverty is that it improves lives. \n"
