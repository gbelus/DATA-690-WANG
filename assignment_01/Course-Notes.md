# Course Notes
## Below are notes from first week's class lecture

In lecture I created:
- A Github Account
- A Deepnote Account

We discussed:

- **README** -    *Introuduce the purpose of the repository*
- **Github** -    *A place where load our outcomes, we use github to have a stucture of storing our work, a **centralize** location*
- **Deepnote**-   *A place where we do our coding*
- **Markdown** -  *Link to a [Mark Down Page](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)*

# Chapter 1

## My Notes, derived from *Python for Data Analysis by Wes Mckinney*

Python - is often called *scripting languages*, one can use to quickly write small programs to automake tasks. Python has become of the most important languages in academia and 
         industry. Python is a popular choice for data analysis tasks and other discpline such as software engineering and data science. 
         
**Essential Python Libraries:**
- *NumPY*
- *pandas*
- *matplotlib*
- *IPython and Jupyter*
- *SciPy*
- *scikit-learn*
- *statsmodels* 

**Import Conventions:**
```
import numpy as np
import matplotib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd 
import seaborn as sns
import statsmodels as sm
```
**Jargon**

- *Munge/munging/wrangling*
- *Pseudocode*
- *Syntactic sugar*
