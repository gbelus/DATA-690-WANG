A colon is followed after a indented code of block, which all \nof the block of code is indented. Whitespaces allows your code to be more readable. Semicolons can be used to seperate multiple code statements on a single line.\n\n\n### Everything is an object\nEverything in Python is a *Python object* with an assocuited *type* and internal data.\n\n### Comments\nTexts followed by a hash tag(#) is a comment, and is ignored by Python interpreter. You can also commment out blocks of codes \nusing the hash tag symbol.\n\n### Function and object method calls\nYou can call functiosn using () and passing arguments, and you can assign the return value to a variable. Methods are attached functions to\nan objects. You can call a method by using object name dot(.) method and parentheses. \n\nExample:\n```obj.some_method(x,y,z)```\n\n### Variables and arguments \n\nIn Python, when you assign a variable to a piece of data, you are creating a reference. \n```a = [1,2,3]```\n```# this is creating a reference to the object(a variable)```\n\nAccording to page 33, **assignment** is also referred as to *binding*.\n\n### Attributes and methods\nIn Python, objects typcially have both attributes and methods. You can access them by the following syntax:\n\n    objectName.attribute_name\n\n### Imports \n\nYou can import variables and functions from *.py* file that is located in the same directory.\n\n### Binary operators and comparisons\n\n- a + b    (Addition)\n- a - b    (Substraction)\n- a * b    (Multiplication)\n- a / b    (Division)\n- a // b   (Remainder)\n- a ** b   (Raise a to the b power)\n- a & b    (True if a and b are True)\n- a | b    (True if either a and b are True)\n (please see page 37 for additional operation examples)\n\n\n### Mutable and immutable objects\nMutable \n- Lists\n- Dicts\n- NumPy arrays\n- most user-defined types(classes)\n\nImmutable \n- Strings\n- Tuble\n\n\n### Scalar Types\nScalar types are built-in types for handing numerical data, strings, boolen values, datas and time. \nExamples of Scalar\n- None\n- str\n- bytes\n- float\n- bool\n- int\n\n### Control Flow\nThere are several built-in keywords for control flow concepts\n- if,elif,and else\n- for loops\n- while loops\n- pass\n- range\n- Ternary expressions\n\nExample 1:\n\n            if x <0: \n                print(\"It's negative\")\n                #if statement\n\n\nExample 2:\n\n             if x <0: \n                print(\"It's negative\")\n            elif x == 0:\n                print(\"Equal to zero\")\n            elif 0<x>5:\n                print(\"Positive but smaller than 5\")\n            else: \n                print(\"Positive and larger than or equal to 5\")\n                #if,elif,and else statement\n\nPlease see pages 47 to 49 for additional examples of control flows listed above.\n\n### Ternary expressions \nAllows you to combibe an *if-else* block into a single line of code, condensing this way may not add readability to your code. \n","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00013-862a2840-225f-4515-8f10-e45867391bae","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}}],"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2,"metadata":{"orig_nbformat":2,"deepnote_notebook_id":"b00b6680-3a42-4bae-9c69-5753b64ec81a","deepnote_execution_queue":[]}}
